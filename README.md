### About bashScript

    **bashScript** permits to create a new script in the working directory
        . Once you've done the `bash bashScript` or the `./bashScript`
        . You must write the name of the script and press enter.
        . Then the text `#!/bin/bash`with a new lineis written in the file.
        . And `chmod u+x` is done to create the script.
