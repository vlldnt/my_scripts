### About bashScript

 **bashScript** permits to create a new script in the working directory
   - Execute with `bash bashScript` or `./bashScript`
   - A `read -p` command is done to collect input to name your file.
   - Then the text `#!/bin/bash` with a new line is written in the new named file.
   - And `chmod u+x` is done to change the permissions.
