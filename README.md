### About bashScript

 **bashScript** permits to create a new script in the working directory

        - Once you've done the `bash bashScript` or the `./bashScript`
        - You must write the name of the script and press enter.
        - Then the text `#!/bin/bash` with a new line is written in the file.
        - And `chmod u+x` is done to change the permissions.
